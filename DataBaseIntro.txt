Database is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed (rows and columns)
In order to manage DB we use DBMS (software application)
DBMS executes the query against database and gives the result.

Two types of DB
	1. Relational DB
	2. Non relational DB

Tables -> where we store the data
views -> virtual tables, where we combine data from one or more tables to generate report
stored_procedures and functions -> little program inside DB to query the data
